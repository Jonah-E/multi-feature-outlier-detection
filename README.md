# Multi-Feature Outlier Detection
A multi-feature outlier detection algorithm for streaming space plasma data.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

Before you get started you will have to have a working jupyter notebook. You can then
install the necissary packages using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the code
The outlier detector, FC-MinMax scaler and dataset are all located in python files which can
be imported as modules. For an example on how to run these you can open the jupyter notebook
outlier_detection.ipynb
